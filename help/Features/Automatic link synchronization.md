# Automatic link synchronization

Let's reference [[SyncNote]] from the `Examples/Links sync` folder and imagine that you decided to rename `SyncNote` to `HelloWorld`. In this case Memo will synchronize [[SyncNote]] links here in this note and all other files automatically. Try to rename that file yourself or check how synchronization looks like from the picture below.
