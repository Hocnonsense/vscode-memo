Memo recognizes the following file formats:

1. Markdown files: `md`;
2. Image files: `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `svg`, `gif`;
3. Other formats: `doc`, `docx`, `odt`, `pdf`, `rtf`, `tex`, `txt`, `wpd`. (Support for opening other formats in the default is coming in the next release)

Markdown files and image files can be referenced via regular links `[[image.png]]` or attached using embed links `![[image.png]]`. These file types also support on-hover and built-in previews ([[Notes and images preview.gif|see how it works]]).
