# Creating notes from links

You can automatically create a [[Note]] if does not exist yet just by clicking on the link using `cmd / ctrl + click` or using VSCode built-in "Open Link" command ![[Open link command.png]] which you can bind to a keyboard shortcut. I use `cmd + enter` as a shortcut for opening the links, but you can come up with the one that fits your workflow best.
