# Creating links

You can use links to refer to any note in your personal knowledge base such as for instance a daily note [[2020-07-05]] or an image resource ![[Creating links.gif]].

To create a link to any resource you can use `[[]]` notation and for embedding resource to show it in built-in preview (only images supported at the moment) please use `![[]]` notation with `!` in the beginning.
